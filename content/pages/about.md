Hi, my name is Veikko Sariola and I like to do stuff, including:

* [Programming](/category/programming.html)
* Robotics
* [Research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GfkEQAMAAAAJ)
* [Teaching](http://www.tiedeteatteri.fi/)
* [Art](http://www.laurasariola.fi/robotloves/)
* Board games
* Computer games
* Beatboxing

Over the years, my computer has become littered with random, mostly unfinished projects along those lines. I figured that I would eventually have to archive all those projects somehow. So I decided to archive them here, online.
