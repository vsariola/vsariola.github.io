Title: C64 Assembly Instructions Cheat Sheet

Over the past two years, I've taught myself to program the C64 in assembly (why?). The best part is when you get to cycle count and optimize the code. I [found](http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:6502_6510_coding) [excellent](http://www.oxyron.de/html/opcodes02.html) [resources](http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/) to learn the assembly instructions; however, I also found myself switching back and forth between the browser window and the IDE all the time. What I needed was a quick cheat sheet with all the addressing modes, instructions, opcodes and cycles. 

After breaking my code so it was beyond fixing, I found designing that cheat sheet good surrogate activity to actual coding. The resulting cheat sheet is shown below. The original file is a SVG made using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). Notice that the SVG uses the font Tw Cent MT and might not display correctly; the correct font is embedded in the released PDF. 

Let me know if you find any mistakes or if you have any ideas how to improve it. Ironically, after designing the cheat sheet, I rarely need it anymore. So designing it was useful! My next plan is to make a cheat sheet of the C64 Memory Map.

PDF and SVG files are available from the [repository](https://github.com/vsariola/c64-cheat-sheets).
